## What is a colophon?

According to the [IndieWeb](https://indieweb.org/colophon), a colophon is defined as follows:

> A colophon is a page or section (typically in a footer) of a site that describes how the site is made, with what tools, supporting what technologies, and often published on personal sites at a top level /colophon page.

## Tools and tech

The code for this website is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/chaezwav/website). This site was written using [Astro](https://astro.build), a Javascript framework for content-based websites, and in [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This website is hosted currently on [Render](https://render.com), but I eventually plan to move off of the platform onto my own server.

## Fonts

The following fonts are utilized and are kept in the `/public/fonts` folder:

<!-- - [Excon](https://www.fontshare.com/?q=Excon) - Headers and links
- [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://www.brailleinstitute.org/freefont/) - Body text -->

- [Commit Mono](https://commitmono.com/)

(These will eventually be on a CDN when I implement one)
