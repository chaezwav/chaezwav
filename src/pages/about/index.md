##  * Professional

Primarily, I am a student at my High School, but outside of that I am a crew member at Dunkin'.

I also volunteer with my local community regarding school and external-organization events.

This was a hobby project to learn web development, but in the past I have worked on some small hobby projects in my free time.

##  * Hobbies

###  * Language Learning

For the past 3 years of High School, I have been learning and practicing Japanese and German. This upcoming year, however, I plan to additionally learn Arabic as a way to challenge myself even more!

###  * Collecting K-Pop Memorabilia

If you take a look at my page, you'll see I tend to listen to a lot of Korean Pop music. This has led to a pretty bad spending habit, but overall enjoyable hobby of collecting albums and other forms of merch.

###  * Photography

I also like to dabble in Photography here and there. I've been experimenting for about a year now, and while I may not be that good, I still thoroughly enjoy it!
